                    HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. 
                    it is the fifth and latest major version of HTML that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
                    recommendation. The current specification is known as the HTLM Living Standard and is maintained 
                    by a consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft), the Web 
                    Hypertext Application technology Working Group (WHATWG). <br><br> HTML5 was first released in a public-facing
                    form on 22 January 2008, with a major update and "W3C Recommendation" statusin October 2014. Its 
                    goals were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other new features; to keep the
                    language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such 
                    as web-browsers, parser, etc., without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible with 
                    older software. HTML5 is inetended to subsume not only HTML 4 but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.

                    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
                    written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside
                    HTML and JavaScript. <br><br> 
                    CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts, This separation can improve content accessibility,
                    provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation charictaristics, enable multiple web pages to share
                    formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content. separationof formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles
                    for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices.
                    CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is access on a movile device. The name cascading come from the specified 
                    priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
                    <br><br>
                    The CSS specifications are maintained by the Wold Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME tyep) text/css is registered
                    for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents. In addition to HTML, 
                    other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.
